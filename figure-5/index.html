    <h1>Figure 5 — Jan Tschichold</h1>
    <p>
        This is figure 5 from Jan Tschicholds book <cite>The Proportions Of The Book</cite> as found in the Dutch translation on page 28. It represents a ratio found in a manuscript from the 14th century. In the original manuscript, there's text in the middle, commentary around it (where this page is rose) surrounded by white-space. I took the freedom to use colours instead of commentary and white-space. I found the colours on <a href="http://ghehehe.nl/the-daily-rectangle/?i=1399964458-339-7-39-343-70-63-141-734.svg">the Daily Rectangle</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the original manuscript the proportions of the paper were 2:3. This is a proportion that could exist on the web, but it is just as common as any other proportion. There are no default proportions on the web. In order to see what Tschichold's theories look like on the web I created this page, strictly using the ratios he describes, but applied in a fluid manner.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the web some important geometry is lost. In the manuscript the width of the rose section is exactly the same as half the height of the paper. This is not possible to achieve on the web. I'm curious how Jan Tschichold would solve this.
    </p>
    <p>
        While in the original manuscript the text in the middle was as wide as the white section we see here, I think this is inappropriate on the web: the measure gets too wide on wider screens which results in unreadable text. The <code>max-width</code> of the text is <code>60ch</code> wide, which is equal to 60 times the width of the zero.
    </p>
    <p>
        This layout <i>works</i> on wider screens, but the measure becomes unreadably small on smaller screens, even when the font-size is made smaller. It seems like page ratios from the 14th century don't translate one on one to the modern web.
