# Two asymmetrical columns

This is clearly an asymmetrical layout. The main column is `11.11%` wider than the [common layout for a book](../eighteen-3/). It touches the diagonal for the *second* page in the top right corner. The left top still aligns with a diagonal, as does the left bottom when you scroll all the way down.

The second column is `11.11%` less wide than the common book layout. It touches two diagonal lines: the right top, and the bottom right corners. On the left it touches an important line. I should find out what to call this line.

The margins are the same as in the [classic book layout](../eighteen-3/). A `margin-top` of `11.11vh`, a left and right margin of `11.11%`, and a `margin-bottom` of `22.222vh`. The width is `33.333%`. This corresponds to the layouts described in Tschicholds essays.

The big difference of course is that this is not a book. All Tschicholds ideas are based on the size of the paper, and there is no such thing as a fixed canvas on the web. Especially the height is flexible: pages usually become higher when the browser window gets smaller. In this excercise I used the viewport size as the size of the canvas.

If the content of this article is higher than the viewport, in other words, *if you have to scroll*, you'll see that the left-bottom of the article aligns with a diagonal. So the layout is not always *perfect*, but it is as good as it gets.
