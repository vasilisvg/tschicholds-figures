# Play with the layout

With this tool you can play with the layout. You can extend or contract both columns into all four directions by clicking on the arrows. They will always change in size with one part at a time, which is either one eighteenth of the width, or one ninth of the height.

## Top

The arrows at the top control the `padding-top` of the whole page. It's not possible to change it for each column individually. Why? Because.

## Bottom

The arrows at the bottom control the `padding-bottom` of the whole page. It's not possible to change it for each column individually. Why? Because.

## Left and right

The arrows at on the left and the right control the `margin-left` and `margin-right` on the left of the element. The columns will become wider or smaller if you press them.

## Toggle the background

If you find the lines on the background confusing or distracting you can click the *Toggle background* button.
