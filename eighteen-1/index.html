	<h1>Two columns</h1>
	<p>This is the classic idea of a two page layout in a book. It's not very common on the web, since you mostly see irregular grids with a main column that's wider.</p>
	<p>
		It has a <code>margin-top</code> of <code>11.11vh</code>, a left and right margin of <code>11.11%</code>, and a <code>margin-bottom</code> of <code>22.222vh</code>. The width is <code>33.333%</code>. This corresponds to the layouts described in Tschicholds essays.
	</p>
	<p>
		The big difference of course is that this is not a book. All Tschicholds ideas are based on the size of the paper, and there is no such thing as a fixed canvas on the web. Especially the height is flexible: pages usually become higher when the browser window gets smaller. In this excercise I used the viewport size as the size of the canvas.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the content of this article is higher than the viewport, in other words, <em>if you have to scroll</em>, you'll see that the left-bottom of the article aligns with a diagonal. So the layout is not always <em>perfect</em>, but it is as perfect as it gets.
	</p>
</article>
<article>
	<h1>The second column</h1>
	<p>
		Of course we could assign <code>min-height: 66.666vh</code> to the article. This way an almost empty article will align with the diagonal.
